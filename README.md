# Animist

Animist is an online anime streaming site built using React.js.

### `npm i` (Install the dependencies)

### `npm start` (Run locally)

### Set up your .env file

First add a .env file in your root directory. Then add <br />
`REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL='https://miyou-api.cyclic.app/' REACT_APP_BASE_URL='https://graphql.anilist.co'`

## Whatâ€™s new

- Text-based brand logo "Animist" in the header (Google Font Zen Dots).
- Updated titles/metadata to Animist; favicon retained.
- New `<Loading />` component with glowing orb animation integrated across pages during data fetch.
- New footer on all pages: "Created by Meeron".

## Todo

### Changing the search page

Add the ability to search genres or search from multiple genres. And sort by Trending or Popularity or User Preference. Something like this.
